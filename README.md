# Employee-Management-system
We want to manage the different employees of a company. For each one, we keep their number, name, social security number, marital status and address.
The company has a boss, salespeople and cashiers. Each employee, except the boss, has a
upper hierarchy. The boss receives his salary, as well as a risk premium, the
Salespeople receive a commission on top of their salary, and cashiers receive
just their salary.
